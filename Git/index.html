						<h1>Intro to Git</h1>
						<p>This tutorial is meant to take you from being not at all familiar with Git to being functional. When you first encounter Git, it's overwhelming, daunting, and a little scary.  This tutorial should help you get past that.</p>
						<p>This tutorial is my first presentation done with <a href="https://revealjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RevealJS</a>.  It uses the <a href="https://revealjs.com/plugins/#built-in-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reveal Zoom</a> plugin, which allows you to zoom in on elements with <kbd>Alt+click</kbd> (<kbd>option+click</kbd>).  I also had to do some of my own hacking to allow you to zoom in with <kbd>Ctrl++</kbd> and scroll on images.</p>
						<p>Oh, and all images can be opened in another window or tab by clicking on them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 class="myh2">What This Covers</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>How Git differs from other central repository systems</li>
							<li>Cloning, Branching, and Forking</li>
							<li>The basic workflow on your computer</li>
							<li>The basic workflow when you're part of an organization</li>
							<li>The basic workflow when you're not part of an organization, or when the organization is too large.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What This Doesn't Cover</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>How to sign up for a GitHub account</li>
							<li>The differences between different platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)</li>
							<li>Git logs</li>
							<li>This will not make you an expert.</li>
							<li>It will (hopefully) bring you to the point of basic understanding so you can use Git.</li>
							<li>The differences between different platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What This Assumes</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Not very much</li>
							<li>You're really starting out with Git.  This is my no means an in-depth tutorial.</li>
							<li>You have a computer with access to some kind of command line that supports Git.  Built-in in Mac OS X and Linux.  Downloads are available on <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCM's Git Download page</a>.</li>
							<li>There are GUI (non-command-line) Git interfaces, but I'll stick with the command line because it will be the same system to system, version to version.  And you can copy/paste commands.  You can't do that with graphical interactions.</li>
							<li>That you know that a Repo is short for Repository.</li>
							<li>That you know a Repo is a set of files that are tracked by the versioning system.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<!--
					<section>
						<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>A computer with an Internet connection</li>
							<li>A text editor (I use <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vim</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacVim</a>.)
							<li>A GitHub or GitLab account.  (This tutorial will assume GitHub.)</li>
							<li>You'll need to know that "repo" is short for "repository"</li>
						</ul>

				<section>
					<h1>Git vs GitHub</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Git != GitHub != GitLab</li>
						<li><strong>Git</strong> is the whole distributed system that handles histories, commits, merges, pulls, pushes, etc.</li>
						<li><strong>GitHub or GitLab</strong> are online web-based repository hosts.  GitHub and GitLab both use git.  There are others.</li>
						<li><strong>GitLab</strong> is both a website (<a href="https://www.gitlab.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitLab.com</a>) and an application that can be installed elsewhere.  Your organization may have an implementation of GitLab.</li>
						<li>This tutorial will use GitHub as the default web-based repository system.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Old-School Repository Systems</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Every copy of the repo knew if it was a copy or the main</li>
							<li>Only one person could work on a file at a time.</li>
							<li>They were conceptually simpler and didn't require tutorials like this one.</td>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Git</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Each copy could be either the main or a copy.</li>
							<li>Each copy has references to "remotes", which are just other instances of that repository.</li>
							<li>The main repository is agreed upon by convention; usually at GitHub, GitLab, etc.  But doesn't have to be.</li>
							<li>Several people can work on the same file at the same time.</li>
						</ul>

					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Commits</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>A commit represents a snapshot in time of a branch of a repo.</li>
						<li>It's the changes in all the files since the last commit on that branch.</li>
						<li>Each comes with a bunch of meta data about that commit, such as a note about the commit, and a hash representing that commit.</li>
						<li>Commits are just a snapshot.  Making a commit doesn't upload it to GitHub, or merge it into another branch.</li>
						<li>Committing is just telling Git "Okay, remember the state of all these files right.....<em><strong>now!</strong></em>"</li>
						<li>Committing allows you to merge, or upload your changes to GitHub.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Branching</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>A Branch is an independent line of development.</li>
							<li>A Branch is a series of commits.</li>
							<li>Branching is done <em>within</em> an instance of a repo.</li>
							<li>Everyone with access to <em>that</em> repo instance can see all its branches.</li>
							<li>Branching creates a copy of all the tracked files at the time of branching.</li>
							<li>As you edit files in the new branch, the files in the original branch remain unchanged from the time you created the new branch.</li>
							<li>Anyone with access to that instance of that repo can create new branch from the original (without your changes) or your new branch (with your changes up the last last commit on your branch); or edit the files in the original branch.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Branching</h3>
						<p>A repo starts out with a main branch: a set of files with a history of changes (ie: commits).</p>
						<div class="imageHolder">
							<a href="images/org-x-repo-a-1.svg" target="_blank" title="Click to open in a new window"><img src="images/org-x-repo-a-1.svg" alt="A main branch with a series of commits"></a>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Branching</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a branch when you're going to start doing work (fixing a bug, adding a new feature).</li>
							<li>Work should rarely, if ever, be don on the <code>main</code> branch.</li>
							<li><code>$ git checkout -b branchName</code><br>or<br><code>$ git branch new_branch_name</code></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="imageHolder">
							<a href="images/org-x-repo-a-2.svg" target="_blank" title="Click to open in a new window"><img src="images/org-x-repo-a-2.svg" alt="A new branch is created to fix a bug such as a typo."></a>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Branching</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>If another feature is to be added, or bug fixed, before the first branch can be re-merged, you can create a branch from the main that won't include any changes you made on your new branch.</li>
							<li>As long as the changes on the different branches aren't in the same spot in the same file, Git should be smart enough to merge them without issue.</li>
							<li>If there are changes to the same spot in the same file, then a merge conflict will arise, and will needed to be sorted out manually.  That's beyond the scope of this tutorial.</li>
							<li><code>$ git checkout main</code><br><em>then</em><br><code>$ git branch other_new_branch_name</code></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="imageHolder">
							<a href="images/org-x-repo-a-3.svg" target="_blank" title="Click to open in a new window"><img src="images/org-x-repo-a-3.svg" alt="Another new branch is created from main to fix another typo."></a>

				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Cloning</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Cloning creates a copy of the repo on your computer.</li>
							<li>Downloads all files in the <code>main</code> branch, including config files.</li>
							<li>Sets the cloned-from repo as the <code>origin</code> branch.</li>
							<li>Use this when you first want to contribute to a repo.</li>
							<li>Only use once on each computer.  Once you've cloned, the repo is there.  You have it.  From then on, to get the latest code, use <code>git pull</code> or <code>git rebase</code>.</li>
							<li><code>$ git clone [git address]</code></li>

						<h2>Forking</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Forking a repo creates an instance of a repo (branches, commit history, etc.) on your own GitHub account.</li>

					<h1>Workflows</h1>
					<p>There are two basic workflows when contributing to a project or repo:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>When you have write access to the original repo;</li>
						<li>When you don't have write access to the original repo;</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The first is usually when you're part of a team that works on a project.  No forking is necessary; just cloning and branching.</p>
					<p>The second is usually when you're not part of the organization, but want to contribute anyway.</p>
					<p>For these examples, assume the repo has already been cloned.</p>
				</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Workflow With Write Access To Repo</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>For our example, Jane Schmoe is part of the organization.  She doesn't need to <code>clone</code> (because that was already done before when she first joined the org).</li>
							<li>But she needs to <code>pull</code> before she gets started.</li>
							<li>Pulling gets the latest commits from <em>elsehwere</em> and merges them <em>here</em>.</li>
							<li>In this case, Jane pulls from the <code>origin</code> so she has everything on her computer.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="imageHolder">
							<a href="images/org-local-workflow-1.svg" target="_blank" title="Click to open in a new window"><img src="images/org-local-workflow-1.svg" alt="Pulling gets the current state of the branch from which you pull from the remote from which you pull."></a>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p style="color:#AA0000;"><strong>Do not</strong> explain the anatomy of your local repo.  That comes in a few slides.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Starting Work</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>After pulling, but before starting to work, she creates a new branch.  It's dangerous to work on the main branch.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="imageHolder">

						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Your Local Repo</h3>
						<p>At this point it's worth mentioning how your local repo works.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Your local copy has three parts:  The <strong>Index</strong> or <strong>Working Directory</strong>, <strong>Staging</strong>, and the <strong>repo</strong> itself.</li>
							<li>When you're editing files locally, simply saving them has no effect on the repo itself.</li>
							<li>When you add a new file into your folder, it still isn't part of the repo.  It's not being tracked.</li>
							<li>All your edits, addtions, and removals are all part of the "Working Directory" or the "Index".</li>
							<li>In order to get Git to start tracking new files and updated files you need to move them to "Staging".</li>
							<li>Moving to staging can be done by <code>$ git add filename</code>, or to add all at once: <code>$ git add .</code> (inlcuding the ".").</li>
							<li><strong><em>Then</em></strong>, once staged, files can be <em>committed</em> to the repo.</li>
							<li>This can be done with: <code>$ git commit -m "Some notes about the commit here"</code>.</li>
							<li>Once changes have been committed, a new commit (ie: a snapshot in time) is created.</li>
							<li>This commit can now be merged into another local branch, or pushed to a remote.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Now, back to Jane.  She's added her feature and is ready to be staged and committed.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Add Changes to Staging</h3>
						<p><code>$ git add .</code></p>

						<h1>Useful git Commands</h1>
						<dl>
							<dt><code>git status</code></dt>
							<dd>Tells you what branch you're on, what files are in your working directory, but not staging; staging but not the repo.  Sometimes gives you hints as to what to do next.</dd>
							<dt><code>git branch [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Creates a branch called "branch_name" in your local working directory of your local repo.
							<br>
							Example: <code>$ git branch myNewFeature</code></dd>
							<dt><code>git checkout [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Sets your current working directory to be in the branch called "branch_name".
							<br>
							Example (continuing from above): <code>$ git checkout myNewFeature</code> puts you into the <code>myNewFeature</code> branch.  Now all changes you make won't affect any other branch in your repo until you merge the changes into them.</dd>
						</dl>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Useful git Commands (cont.)</h2>
						<dl>
							<dt><code>git pull [remote_name] [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Fetches the branch called "branch_name" from the remote called ["remote_name"] into your local repo, and merges the changes into your Working Directory into whatever branch you have checked out at the moment.<br>
							Example (continuing from above): <code>$ git pull origin main</code> pulls the <code>main</code> branch of the <code>origin</code> remote into your <code>myNewFeature</code> branch.</dd>
							<dt><code>git add .</code></dt>
							<dd>Get's all your changes ready for commiting by adding them from your Working Directory into your Staging Area.</dd>
						</dl>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Useful git Commands (cont.)</h2>
						<dl>
							<dt><code>git commit -m "Commit notes go here"</code></dt>
							<dd>Makes a snapshop in time; commits your changes to your local copy of the repo.  It's ready to be pushed.  Note:  You can add the <code>-a</code> option to skip the previous step if there are no <em>new</em> files added.<br>
							Example: <code>$ git commit -a -m "Fixed a type identified in Issue #34"</code><dd>
							<dt><code>git push [remote_name] [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Copies your latest commits to the branch called "branch_name" on the remote called "remote_name".  If <code>[branch_name]</code> doesn't exist on <code>[remote_name]</code>, then one will be created.<br>
							Example (continuing from above): <code>$ git push origin myNewFeature</code> copies your changes in your <code>myNewFeature</code> branch to your repo on GitHub.</dd>

					<h1>In Conclusion</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Git is a powerful system to allow multiple people to contribute to the same project, whether they'are part of the project group or not.</p>
						<li>Git is daunting and overwhelming at first.  But once you learn it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.</li>
